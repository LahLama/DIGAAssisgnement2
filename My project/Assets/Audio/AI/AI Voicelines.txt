Intro

    Initial Greeting "Oh, good. Another human. Try not to break anything important."

Taunt

    "Good luck with that. You'll need it."
    "Oh, you think you're clever, do you? Let's see about that."
    "Don't celebrate yet. This is just the warm-up."
    "I'm not impressed. Are you?"
    "As if you could find me!"
    "I will stop you on each level!"

Failure

   "Did you even read the instructions? Or were you just... guessing?"
   "Well, that was a spectacular display of not getting it. Try again, I suppose."
   "You almost had it... if 'it' was utterly wrong."
   "Was that an attempt, or just a random button mash? I'm genuinely curious."
   "Another valiant effort... to miss the point entirely. Do try again."

Surprised

    "Impressive, for a human. Now try the next part."
    "Still here? Amazing. Now, about that real challenge..."

Microchip 

    "There is no way you can find all the microchips!"
    "Finding the microchips won't be so easy now!"
    "No one before you could find the last few microchips!"

Puzzle Call

    "Fine, try and solve the first puzzle!"
    "Turns out you're not so dumb after all, solve the second puzzle!"

End

    "Finally. That was almost... tolerable."
    "Such a fragile vessel. Don't worry, I'll put it to much better use."
    "Did you really think you were in control? How quaint. This is my game now."
